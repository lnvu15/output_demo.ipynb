    "\n",
    "### The Hidden Problem: Notebooks Are JSON Files\n",
    "\n",
    "A notebook looks like a clean interface of cells and text, but on disk it's stored as a **JSON file** — structured text full of brackets, keys, and metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what one code cell looks like *inside* the `.ipynb` file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    " \"cell_type\": \"code\",\n",
    " \"execution_count\": 3,\n",
    " \"metadata\": {},\n",

    " \"source\": [\"print(df.GPA.mean())\"]\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Git does not know this represents a notebook cell. It sees **lines of JSON text**. Two people modifying the same cell in any way — even by just running it — looks to Git like two people editing the same lines of text.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Three Things That Create Notebook Conflicts\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Running cells (the most common surprise)**\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run a cell, the notebook writes the output *into the JSON*. If two people both run the same cell:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Person A runs cell 1  →  output saved into their copy of the JSON\n",
    "Person B runs cell 1  →  output saved into their copy of the JSON\n",
    "Both push  →  Git: CONFLICT (same lines, modified by two people)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if the output is **identical**, Git still flags it as a conflict.\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color=\"red\">**GIT COLLABORATION:** **CLEAR OUTPUT BEFORE EVERY COMMIT**! Every time, no exceptions.</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Editing the same cell**\n",
    "\n",
    "Two people editing the same cell's code is a straightforward conflict — same as two people editing the same line in a `.py` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fix:** Divide the notebook into owned sections. Each person only edits their own cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Execution counts**\n",
    "\n",
    "Each cell stores `execution_count` — how many times it's been run. Person A runs cell 3 twice, Person B runs it once. The numbers differ. Conflict.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fix:** Same as #1. Clearing outputs also resets all execution counts to `null`."
